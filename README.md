# LBYARCH Machine Project

This repository contains a implementation of the SAXPY operation (A*X + Y), a fundamental linear algebra computation used in various scientific and engineering applications. The project showcases two versions of the SAXPY kernel: one written in C Language and another in x86-64 assembly language, both designed to leverage their computational efficiency on the said SAXPY operation.
